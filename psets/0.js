The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var job = "developer";
var location = "miami";
var partner = "Bob";
var children = 1;

console.log ( "You will be a " + job + " in " + location + ", and married to " + partner + " with " + children + " kid(s).");
